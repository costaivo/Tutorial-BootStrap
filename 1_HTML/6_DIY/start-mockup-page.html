    Full Stack Developer
    A Full-Stack Web Developer is someone who is able to work on both the front-end and back-end portions of an application. Front-end generally refers to the portion of an application the user will see or interact with, and the back-end is the part of the application that handles the logic, database interactions, user authentication, server configuration, etc. Being a Full-Stack Developer doesnâ€™t mean that you have necessarily mastered everything required to work with the front-end or
    back-end, but it means that you are able to work on both sides and understand what is going on when building an application.
