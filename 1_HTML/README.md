# HTML

## What is HTML

HTML stands for _Hyper Text markup language_
A Markup language basically annotates the text so that the computer can manipulate that text.

When a browser (IE,Chrome,Firefox) displays a webpage, it reads the contents and interprets the HTML.

## TAGS

- HTML is made up of tags
- Tags tell the browser where an element should start and end
- The markup tags are **<** and **>**
- tags should be lowercase
- each tag and its content is an **HTML element**

## Elements

```html
<p>this is a paragraph element</p>
```

Above is a paragraph element. The text content inside the **P** tag is formatted as a paragraph when dispalyed on the browser

```html
<h1>Heading 1</h1>
<h2>Heading 2</h2>
<h3>Heading 3</h3>
<h4>Heading 4</h4>
<h5>Heading 5</h5>
<h6>Heading 6</h6>
```

Above are list of various header elements.

## Empty Elements

Elements usually have a start and closing tag, like <p></p>. But there are some elements which dont have closing tag, this type of tags are called **Empty tags**

```html
<br />
<input />
<hr />
```

## Commeting HTML Code

A comment starts with the tag **<!--** and ends with tag **-->**. Whatever content is added inside a comment tag is never displayed in the browser.

## Summary

- HTML element starts with a opening tag
- HTML element ends with a closing tag
- The letters between the < and > are abbreviations
- The element content is everything between the start tag and the end tag
- Some HTML elements are empty
- Empty elements are closed in the start tag
- Make it a habit to type all your tags in lowercase - it is considered good practice
